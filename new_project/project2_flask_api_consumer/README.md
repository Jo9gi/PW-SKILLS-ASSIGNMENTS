# Flask API Consumer

This project is a Flask application that consumes data from a public API (JSONPlaceholder) and displays a subset of the data in a user-friendly HTML format.

## About the API

The API used is [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), a free online REST API for testing and prototyping. It provides fake data such as posts, comments, users, and more. This API is useful for:

- Testing frontend and backend applications without needing a real backend.
- Prototyping and experimenting with API calls.
- Learning and practicing API integration.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Flask app:
```
python app.py
```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see the API data.
